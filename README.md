# rrss2imap

[![Built with cargo-make](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/assets/badges/cargo-make.svg)](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make)

rrss2imap is a Rust reimplementation of the classical Python script [rss2imap](https://github.com/rcarmo/rss2imap)

Goals of this project include

* Having a reasonably performant implementation of rss2imap
* Learn Rust
* Explore parallel mechanism
* Maybe provide some kind of image embedding with cache

## Getting Started

* clone this repository
* run `cargo run`

### Prerequisites

You need a complete rust build chain

To perform a release, you'll also need

* [cargo make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make#usage-predefined-flows)
* [cargo release](https://github.com/sunng87/cargo-release)
* [git journal](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal)
* [cargo hublish](https://github.com/chasinglogic/cargo-hublish)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
